# Algoritmica

In `Algoritmica_PC/Old` there are almost all the excercises I did to get ready for the Algorithmic exam.\
The naming should be self explanatory in most cases, but I will update this readme and the comments in the code to make this repository a bit more useful.

## Formulario

This is maybe the most useful file (not so well) of the entire repo as it contains all the sorting algorithms, some templates of the main data structures in C and some other useful stuff.
